# Hackathon Presentation Guide
The following is a sample outline for a 4-4.5 minute hackathon presentation.

## 1. The Hook (10-15 seconds)
Capture the judges attention. Why should they pay attention to you? 
   
**Must Haves**  
- what you built
- who it's for
- what problem it addresses
  
**Constraints**
- 1-2 sentences max
- present-tense
- do NOT get technical
  
**Examples**
- The Peel Exchange is a simulated stock market game for monkey's who need to learn how to invest properly.
- CIVIC helps local communities organize events in an organized, easy to understand way.

## 2. The Problem (30 seconds)
What are you trying to address? Why should the judges care?  
**Must Haves**
- who it affects (think college students, construction workers, etc.)
- a scenario
- why existing solutions fall short

**Constraints**
- keep it to a specific group, no global claims
- make sure it is a real problem

**Example**
- Our college campus has many events that take place everyday. Students running those events create flyers and put them on a campus bulletin board. There's just one small issue with that, you can't see any of the flyers. (show image of messy board) And our campus has tried using an event calendar online but hardly any of the students know of it's existence.

## 3. The Solution (30 seconds)
What have you created today?  
**Must Haves**
- what your solution does
- how does the user interact with it
  
**Constraints**
- don't dive into tech stack
- don't talk about future implementations yet

**Examples**
- Our solution is CIVIC. It allows a member of the community to create an event that is taking place, with details, the time and place, and contact information. This event is then posted to the feed and calendar, which all members can see.
- The Peel Exchange creates an easy to use stock market game. Users, or "monkeys", can select a stock and buy it. They can then view their profile and sell it at either a loss or a profit. Stocks are updated every 30 seconds to keep things interesting.

## 4. Demo (60-90 seconds)
Does it work? What do you have today?  
**The Dos**
- show what you created in the 24 hours
- show the functionality
- talk about your solution and model how a user would use it

**The Don'ts**
- talk about 'we would have'
- future plans
- technical details

The goal is to walk through how a user would utilize your solution. Even if you just have mockup designs, walk through how a user would use it.

## 5. Technical Insight (45-60 seconds)
Why is your solution well-designed?
**Must Haves**
- detail 1-2 technical decisions you made and the benefit of those as opposed to alternatives
- talk about what you learned, what the biggest and best pieces of your technical solution are
- struggles and overcoming those struggles is helpful

**Don't Do This**
- ramble about every small technical decision made
- use a ton of big words, keep it technical but understandable

**Example**
- We used Django because it allowed us to quickly but securely add user authentication, an admin panel, and ...

## 6. The Future (30 seconds)
Will this matter beyond the competition? What do you intend to add?
**Must Haves**
- why keep going?
- next steps

**Examples**
- This could be implemented on campus by next semester, and pushed to current and incoming students as a new way to share events going on.
- Our next steps involve adding different user account types, a mobile interface (just to name some examples)

## 7. Close (10-15 seconds)
Keep this short but impactful. It is the last thing they will hear from you. Make sure it recaps your problem and solution without feeling like a rehash of what you've already said.


### Additional Suggestion
Based on what the judges have said, if anything, tailor your presentation toward what they want to hear. If they are a business owner, include some more business oriented details such as operating costs. If they're a computer science grad student, maybe spend more time on the technical details.
